# ReceiptScanner-API
RESTful API-server for receipt scanner client

---

## Installation guide

There are three supported methods for building the application: utilizing Docker Compose (recommended), using standalone Docker commands, or performing a manual build from source
### Building with Docker-compose
1. Check if you have docker and docker-compose installed
2. Go to project direcory and run: ``` docker compose up ```  
That`s it!

Compose automatically creates shared directory /storage, where all your database data and logs will be stored in.

### Building with Docker

1. Check if you have docker installed.
2. To build container run ` build.sh ` script
3. To launch app run ` run.sh ` script

All shell scripts are located in app/sh_files directory.  

In this method app uses *receipt_scanner* docker volume to store data.  
Backup of database, logs and other data can be created by running ` ./make_backup ` script. It will copy all files from receipt_scanner docker volume and create .tar archive in current directory.

By default, server will run on port 8000. If you need other port, change -p flag in `run.sh` script like this: *docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> ...*

### Building from source 
1. create python venv and install dependencies:
    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Go to project dir and create .env file with SECRET_KEY (requuired by Flask):
    ```
    cd app
    SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32 | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}')
    echo "SECRET_KEY=$SECRET_KEY" > .env
    ```
3. To launch app, run:
    ```
    gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 main:app
    ```

## Notes on Response Structures:

- All authenticated routes require JWT Bearer token passed in the `Authorization` header.
- PDF reports and receipt images are served as file downloads from server storage.
- Receipt data structure depends on database schema (see `db` module).
- Category list is static as implemented.
